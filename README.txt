# CleanHPLC
Easy software to clean HPLC outcomes from our loved HPLC in lab N229. I know you love spending a couple of hours mining your data, but in case you have even funnier things to do just use this software to speed it up. 

To use this software just run the it from your teminal using the name of your data retrieval file as a variable argument (e.g: python cleanHPLC.py data_retrieval_file). This software works with the output file generated if you perform the data retrieval as described in the hardcopy manual next to the HPLC (selecting the first 3 options choosing "tabs" as separation method).
